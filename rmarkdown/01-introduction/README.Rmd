This project contains the materials for lesson 1 of the [R Markdown Primer](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). Each of the lessons in this primer begins with a README file like this one, which will pop up in your source pane when you open the lesson.

This lesson is quite easy, all you have to do is read some text and watch a video. To begin the lesson, press the play button at the top right of the code chunk below. Then refer to the viewer pane.

```{r}
viewer <- getOption("viewer")
viewer("https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html", 
       height = "maximize")
```
