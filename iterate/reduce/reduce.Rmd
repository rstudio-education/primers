## Reduce

### \t

There's another way to iterate over vectors that we haven't looked at. Look at what `sum()` does. 

```{r}
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
sum(vec)
```

`sum()` reduces the original vector to a single number computed from the original vector. Many functions in R do something similar: `prod()`, `max()`, `min()`, ...

### Reducing lists

Can we do this with a list? You bet! But not with `sum()` alone. Like almost all R functions, `sum()` is not written to work with lists.

```{r sum2}
list3 <- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
sum(list3)
```

Re-enter the purrr package.

### reduce()

The `reduce()` function in purrr reduces the elements of a vector into a single result. Like `map()`, it works with both simple vectors and lists. Also like `map()`, it uses a function that you supply to do its job.

```{r reduce1, exercise = TRUE}
reduce(list3, sum)
```

```{r reduce1-setup}
list3 <- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
```

```

```{r reduce1-solution}
reduce(list3, sum)
```

```{r reduce1-check}
"reduce() performs its magic in a very particular way. Let's investigate."
```

### How it happens

`reduce()` follows a specifc algorithm to return its result. `reduce()`:

1. first applies your function to the first two elements of the vector
1. then applies your function to the result of the previous step and the next element in the vector
1. continues this process until no elements are left

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/reduce.png")
```

### \t

You can use the `accumulate()` function to see this process in action. It works like `reduce()`, but returns a vector that contains the results from each step of the reduction.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/accumulate.png")
```

* Predict what will happen if you change `reduce()` to `accumulate()` in the code below. Then make the change and click Submit Answer.

```{r accumulate, exercise = TRUE}
reduce(list3, sum)
```

```{r accumulate-setup}
list3 <- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
```

```{r accumulate-solution}
accumulate(list3, sum)
```

```{r accumulate-check}

### When to use reduce

You shouldn't use `reduce()` with every function that takes a vector and returns a single number. `reduce()` returns the correct answer with `sum()`
